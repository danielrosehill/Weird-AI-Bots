# Weird AI Bots - Character Configs 
 
Library of configurations for intentionally weird and offbeat AI characters. 

These can be used in just about any platform that supports AI -human "interaction" - but I try most of these out on speech to speech platforms (Play.ai, Vapi, etc)

Unlike some of my AI agents/assistants that I hope will do something useful, nothing too serious or ambitious is intended here, although sometimes I try to see if these characters can actually be unexpectedly insightful or profound. 

I like to use these to explore the capabilities of STS platforms - but also just to have a laugh.

## Import Instructions

This is simply a collection of system prompts. I like to capture system prompts using speech to text. And I'm pretty bad about fixing up typos. So it's worth having a proofread if any of these sounds like fun. If contextual data is required, I'll make a note of it.
